      <p>
        <em>Last modified: September 30, 2025</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        These Terms of Service (the "Agreement") explain the terms and
        conditions by which you may access and use <strong>rootfi.org</strong>,{" "}
        <strong>app.rootfi.org</strong>, and any subdomains associated with the
        Website (collectively, the "Website"). You must read this Agreement
        carefully as it governs your use of the Website. By accessing or using
        the Website, you signify that you have read, understand, and agree to be
        bound by this Agreement in its entirety. If you do not agree, you are
        not authorized to access or use the Website and should not use the
        Website.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The Website provides access to (a) a decentralized protocol on various
        public blockchains, including but not limited to Ethereum, BNB Chain,
        Base, Arbitrum and Bitcoin, that allow users to interact with digital
        assets ("the RootFi protocol" or the "Protocol"), among other services.
        The Website is one, but not the exclusive, means of accessing the
        Protocol.
      </p>

      <p>
        To access the Website, you must use either non-custodial wallet software
        or third-party authentication providers, which allow you to interact
        with public blockchains. Your relationship with these providers is
        governed by the applicable terms of service of those third parties, not
        this Agreement. These services are not operated by, maintained by, or
        affiliated with us, and we do not have custody or control over any user
        assets and have no ability to retrieve or transfer their contents. By
        connecting to our Website, you agree to be bound by this Agreement and
        all of the terms incorporated herein by reference.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Modification of this Agreement</h2>
      <p>
        We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to modify this Agreement
        from time to time. If we make any modifications, we will notify you by
        updating the date at the top of the Agreement and by maintaining a
        current version of the Agreement at{" "}
        <strong>https://rootfi.org/terms</strong>. All modifications will be
        effective immediately upon posting, and your continued accessing or use
        of the Website will serve as confirmation of your acceptance of those
        modifications.{" "}
        <strong>
          We are under no obligation to notify you of any modifications to this
          Agreement through any other means.
        </strong>{" "}
        If you do not agree with any modifications to this Agreement, you must
        immediately stop accessing and using the Website.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Website for Accessing Protocol</h2>
      <p>
        The Website is distinct from the underlying decentralized protocols and
        is one, but not the exclusive, means of accessing digital asset
        operations. These operations are executed through existing decentralized
        protocols and public blockchains, which RootFi does not control or
        operate. By using the Website, you understand that you are not buying or
        selling digital assets from us and that we do not control transaction
        execution or asset management. All operations are processed through
        independent decentralized networks, where RootFi serves solely as an
        interface provider. When users participate in any operations, associated
        fees accrue to the respective decentralized protocols and their
        participants. As a general matter, the RootFi team does not participate
        in asset management or transaction processing, which are handled by
        independent third parties.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Eligibility</h2>
      <p>
        The RootFi website is for informational purposes only. RootFi is not
        part of any transaction on blockchain networks; we do not have
        possession, custody, or control over any crypto assets or users' funds.
        You understand that when you interact with decentralized protocols, you
        always retain control over your crypto assets.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a condition to accessing or using the Website, you represent and
        warrant that:

        </li>
        <li>
          You are not a resident, national, or agent of any restricted
          territories subject to comprehensive sanctions or embargoes, including

          restrictions on digital asset transactions;

        <li>
          You do not and will not use VPN software or any other privacy or
          anonymization tools or techniques to circumvent, or attempt to
          circumvent, any restrictions that apply;
        </li>
        <li>
          Your access does not violate any applicable laws, regulations, or
          sanctions;
        </li>
        <li>

      <h3>6.2 Non-Custodial and No Fiduciary Duties</h3>
      <p>
        The Website is a purely non-custodial application, meaning we do not
        ever have custody, possession, or control of your digital assets at any
        time. It further means you are solely responsible for the custody of the
        cryptographic private keys to the digital asset wallets you hold and you
        should never share your wallet credentials or seed phrase with anyone.
        We accept no responsibility for, or liability to you, in connection with
        your use of a wallet and make no representations or warranties regarding
        how the Website will operate with any specific wallet. Likewise, you are
        solely responsible for any associated wallet and we are not liable for
        any acts or omissions by you in connection with or as a result of your
        wallet being compromised.
      </p>

      <p>
        This Agreement is not intended to, and does not, create or impose any
        fiduciary duties on us. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you
        acknowledge and agree that we owe no fiduciary duties or liabilities to
        you or any other party, and that to the extent any such duties or
        liabilities may exist at law or in equity, those duties and liabilities
        are hereby irrevocably disclaimed, waived, and eliminated. You further
        agree that the only duties and obligations that we owe you are those set
        out expressly in this Agreement.
      </p>

      <h3>6.3 Compliance and Tax Obligations</h3>
      <p>
        The Website may not be available or appropriate for use in your
        jurisdiction. By accessing or using the Website, you agree that you are
        solely and entirely responsible for compliance with all laws and
        regulations that may apply to you.
      </p>

      <p>
        Specifically, your use of the Website or the Protocol may result in
        various tax consequences, such as income or capital gains tax,
        value-added tax, goods and services tax, or sales tax in certain
        jurisdictions. It is your responsibility to determine whether taxes
        apply to any transactions you initiate or receive and, if so, to report
        and/or remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority.
      </p>

      <h3>6.4 Release of Claims</h3>
      <p>
        You expressly agree that you assume all risks in connection with your
        access and use of the Website. You further expressly waive and release
        us from any and all liability, claims, causes of action, or damages
        arising from or in any way relating to your use of the Website. If you
        are a California resident, you waive the benefits and protections of
        California Civil Code § 1542, which provides: "[a] general release does
        not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know
        or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the
        release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected
        his or her settlement with the debtor or released party."
      </p>

      <h2>7. Disclaimers</h2>
      <h3>7.1 Assumption of Risk</h3>
      <p>
        By accessing and using the Website, you represent that you are
        financially and technically sophisticated enough to understand the
        inherent risks associated with using cryptographic and blockchain-based
        systems, and that you have a working knowledge of the usage and
        intricacies of digital assets such as ether (ETH), so-called
        stablecoins, and other digital tokens such as those following the
        Ethereum Token Standard (ERC-20), or standards of any other digital
        tokens which are transacted on RootFi.
      </p>

      <p>
        In particular, you understand that the markets for these digital assets
        are nascent and highly volatile due to risk factors including (but not
        limited to) adoption, speculation, technology, security, and regulation.
        You understand that anyone can create a token, including fake versions
        of existing tokens and tokens that falsely claim to represent projects,
        and acknowledge and accept the risk that you may mistakenly transact
        with those or other tokens. So-called stablecoins may not be as stable
        as they purport to be, may not be fully or adequately collateralized,
        and may be subject to panics and runs.
      </p>

      <p>
        Further, you understand that smart contract transactions automatically
        execute and settle, and that blockchain-based transactions are
        irreversible when confirmed. You acknowledge and accept that the cost
        and speed of transacting with cryptographic and blockchain-based systems
        such as Ethereum are variable and may increase dramatically at any time.
        You further acknowledge and accept the risk of interacting with
        decentralized protocols under high volatility conditions, which may
        result in significant price slippage and higher costs.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, you understand that we do not create, own, or operate
        cross-chain bridges and we do not make any representation or warranty
        about the safety or soundness of any cross-chain bridge, including its
        use for RootFi governance.
      </p>

      <p>
        In summary, you acknowledge that we are not responsible for any of these
        variables or risks, do not own or control the Protocol, and cannot be
        held liable for any resulting losses that you experience while accessing
        or using the Website. Accordingly, you understand and agree to assume
        full responsibility for all of the risks of accessing and using the
        Website to interact with the Protocol.
      </p>

      <h3>7.2 No Warranties</h3>
      <p>
        The Website is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. TO THE
        FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ANY REPRESENTATIONS AND
        WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY,
        INCLUDING (BUT NOT LIMITED TO) THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
        FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You acknowledge and agree that your
        use of the Website is at your own risk. We do not represent or warrant
        that access to the Website will be continuous, uninterrupted, timely, or
        secure; that the information contained in the Website will be accurate,
        reliable, complete, or current; or that the Website will be free from
        errors, defects, viruses, or other harmful elements. No advice,
        information, or statement that we make should be treated as creating any
        warranty concerning the Website. We do not endorse, guarantee, or assume
        responsibility for any advertisements, offers, or statements made by
        third parties concerning the Website.
      </p>

      <p>
        Similarly, the Protocol is provided "AS IS", at your own risk, and
        without warranties of any kind. Although we contributed to the initial
        code for the Protocol, we do not provide, own, or control the Protocol,
        which is run autonomously without any headcount by smart contracts
        deployed on various blockchains. Upgrades and modifications to the
        Protocol are generally managed in a community-driven way through
        discussions, proposals, and contributions from independent developers
        and users. No developer or entity involved in creating the Protocol will
        be liable for any claims or damages whatsoever associated with your use,
        inability to use, or your interaction with other users of, the Protocol,
        including any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, punitive
        or consequential damages, or loss of profits, cryptocurrencies, tokens,
        or anything else of value. We do not endorse, guarantee, or assume
        responsibility for any advertisements, offers, or statements made by
        third parties concerning the Website.
      </p>

      <h3>7.3 Non-Solicitation; No Investment Advice</h3>
      <p>
        You agree and understand that: (a) all transactions you submit through
        the Website are considered unsolicited, which means that they are solely
        initiated by you; (b) you have not received any investment advice from
        us in connection with any transactions; and (c) we do not conduct a
        suitability review of any transactions you submit.
      </p>

      <p>
        We may provide information about tokens in the Website sourced from
        third-party data partners through features such as rarity scores, token
        explorer or token lists. We may also provide warning labels for certain
        tokens. The provision of informational materials does not make
        transactions in those tokens solicited; we are not attempting to induce
        you to make any purchase as a result of information provided. All such
        information provided by the Website is for informational purposes only
        and should not be construed as investment advice or a recommendation
        that a particular token is a safe or sound investment. You should not
        take, or refrain from taking, any action based on any information
        contained in the Website. By providing token information for your
        convenience, we do not make any investment recommendations to you or
        opine on the merits of any transaction or opportunity. You alone are
        responsible for determining whether any investment, investment strategy
        or related transaction is appropriate for you based on your personal
        investment objectives, financial circumstances, and risk tolerance.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Indemnification</h2>
      <p>
        You agree to hold harmless, release, defend, and indemnify us and our
        officers, directors, employees, contractors, agents, affiliates, and
        subsidiaries from and against all claims, damages, obligations, losses,
        liabilities, costs, and expenses arising from: (a) your access and use
        of the Website; (b) your violation of any term or condition of this
        Agreement, the right of any third party, or any other applicable law,
        rule, or regulation; and (c) any other party's access and use of the
        Website with your assistance or using any device or account that you own
        or control.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL WE OR ANY OF OUR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS,
        EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS, AGENTS, AFFILIATES, OR SUBSIDIARIES BE LIABLE TO
        YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR
        EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING (BUT NOT LIMITED TO) DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF
        PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE PROPERTY, ARISING OUT
        OF OR RELATING TO ANY ACCESS OR USE OF THE INTERFACE, NOR WILL WE BE
        RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE, LOSS, OR INJURY RESULTING FROM HACKING,
        TAMPERING, OR OTHER UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS OR USE OF THE INTERFACE OR THE
        INFORMATION CONTAINED WITHIN IT. WE ASSUME NO LIABILITY OR
        RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY: (A) ERRORS, MISTAKES, OR INACCURACIES OF
        CONTENT; (B) PERSONAL INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE, OF ANY NATURE
        WHATSOEVER, RESULTING FROM ANY ACCESS OR USE OF THE INTERFACE; (C)
        UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS OR USE OF ANY SECURE SERVER OR DATABASE IN OUR
        CONTROL, OR THE USE OF ANY INFORMATION OR DATA STORED THEREIN; (D)
        INTERRUPTION OR CESSATION OF FUNCTION RELATED TO THE INTERFACE; (E)
        BUGS, VIRUSES, TROJAN HORSES, OR THE LIKE THAT MAY BE TRANSMITTED TO OR
        THROUGH THE INTERFACE; (F) ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN, OR LOSS OR DAMAGE
        INCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE USE OF, ANY CONTENT MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH
        THE INTERFACE; AND (G) THE DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE, OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF
        ANY THIRD PARTY.

      <h2>10. Governing Law, Dispute Resolution and Class Action Waivers</h2>
      <h3>10.1 Governing Law</h3>
      <p>
        You agree that this Agreement and any Dispute between you and us shall
        be governed by the laws of a jurisdiction determined by RootFi, without
        regard to principles of conflict of laws. You further agree that the
        Website shall be deemed to be based solely in the jurisdiction chosen by
        RootFi, and that although the Website may be available in other
        jurisdictions, its availability does not give rise to general or
        specific personal jurisdiction in any forum outside the chosen
        jurisdiction. Any arbitration conducted pursuant to this Agreement shall
        follow internationally recognized arbitration rules. You agree that the
        courts of the chosen jurisdiction are the proper forum for any appeals
        of an arbitration award or for court proceedings in the event that this
        Agreement's binding arbitration clause is found to be unenforceable.
      </p>

      <h3>10.2 Dispute Resolution</h3>
      <p>
        We will use our best efforts to resolve any potential disputes through
        informal, good faith negotiations. If a potential dispute arises, you
        must contact us by sending an email to <strong>legal@rootfi.org</strong>{" "}
        so that we can attempt to resolve it without resorting to formal dispute
        resolution. If we aren't able to reach an informal resolution within
        sixty days of your email, then you and we both agree to resolve the
        potential dispute according to the process set forth below.
      </p>

      <p>
        Any claim or controversy arising out of or relating to the Website, this
        Agreement, or any other acts or omissions for which you may contend that
        we are liable, including (but not limited to) any claim or controversy
        as to arbitrability ("Dispute"), shall be finally and exclusively
        settled by arbitration in a jurisdiction determined by RootFi. The
        arbitration shall be confidential, conducted by a single arbitrator, and
        follow internationally recognized arbitration rules.
      </p>

      <h3>10.3 Class Action and Jury Trial Waiver</h3>
      <p>
        You must bring any and all Disputes against us in your individual
        capacity and not as a plaintiff in or member of any purported class
        action, collective action, private attorney general action, or other
        representative proceeding. This provision applies to class arbitration.
        You and we both agree to waive the right to demand a trial by jury.
      </p>

      <h2>11. Miscellaneous</h2>
      <h3>11.1 Entire Agreement</h3>
      <p>
        These terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us with
        respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement supersedes any and
        all prior or contemporaneous written and oral agreements, communications
        and other understandings (if any) relating to the subject matter of the
        terms.
      </p>

      <h3>11.2 Not Registered with the SEC or Any Other Agency</h3>
      <p>
        We are not registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
        as a national securities exchange or in any other capacity. You
        understand and acknowledge that we do not broker trading orders on your
        behalf. We also do not facilitate the execution or settlement of your
        transactions, which occur entirely on public distributed blockchains
        like Ethereum. As a result, we do not (and cannot) guarantee market best
        pricing or best execution through the Website or any features available
        on the Website. Any references in the Website to potential returns,
        market conditions, or performance do not constitute a representation or
        warranty about pricing available through the Website, on the Protocol,
        or elsewhere.
