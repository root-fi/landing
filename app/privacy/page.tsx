      <p>
        This Privacy Policy (the "Policy") explains how RootFi ("we," "us," or
        "our") collects, uses, and protects information related to your use of{" "}
        <strong>rootfi.org</strong>, <strong>app.rootfi.org</strong>, and any
        subdomains associated with the Website (collectively, the "Website").
        You must read this Policy carefully as it governs your use of the
        Website. By accessing or using the Website, you signify that you have
        read, understand, and agree to be bound by this Policy in its entirety.
        If you do not agree, you are not authorized to access or use the Website
        and should not use the Website.

      <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        At RootFi, we prioritize user privacy and operate on a privacy-first
        approach. Our Website minimizes data collection while maximizing
        security and user autonomy, ensuring a transparent and decentralized
        experience. When you interact with the Website, we collect only:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Publicly-available blockchain data.</strong> When you connect
          your non-custodial blockchain wallet to the Website, we collect and
          log your publicly-available blockchain address to learn more about
          your use of the Website and to screen your wallet for any prior
          illicit activity. We screen your wallet using intelligence provided by
          leading blockchain analytics providers. Note that blockchain addresses
          are publicly-available data that are not created or assigned by us or
          any central party, and by themselves are not personally identifying.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>
            Information from localStorage and other tracking technologies.
          </strong>{" "}
          We and our third-party service providers may access and collect
          information from localStorage, mobile device ID, cookies, web beacons,
          and other similar technologies to provide and personalize the Website
          and its features for you across sessions. We may also use this
          information to learn about your preferences, your use of the Website,
          and our interactions with you. Information we collect from these
          technologies may include browser type, referring/exit pages, operating
          system, device or browser language, and other device information. We
          group and analyze these user journeys collectively, in the aggregate,
          to improve our product user experience.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Information from other sources.</strong> We may receive
          information about your wallet address or transactions visible on
          public blockchains from our service providers in order to comply with
          our legal obligations and prevent the use of our Website in connection
          with fraudulent or other illicit activities.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Survey or usability information.</strong> If you choose to
          participate in a survey or usability study with us, we will record any
          biographical information you voluntarily provide to us (for example,
          your name, email, and job title), the responses you provide, and your
          interactions with the Website.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Correspondence.</strong> We will receive any communications
          and information you provide voluntarily via email, customer support,
          social media, or another support channel (such as Twitter or Discord),
          or when you participate in any surveys or questionnaires.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Information you specifically provide us.</strong> If you
          provide us with specific information (such as your email address), we
          may use that information for the purposes described when you provide
          it. We will not attempt to link any information you provide to your
          wallet address, IP address, or other personal data. You do not need to
          provide us with any personal data to use the Website.

      <h2>4. Cookies, Tracking Technologies, and Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        We may use third-party services that employ tracking technologies such
        as cookies, device identifiers, and localStorage to improve
        functionality, enhance security, and analyze aggregated usage patterns
        on the Website. These technologies help optimize performance while
        maintaining a privacy-conscious approach. Additionally, certain
